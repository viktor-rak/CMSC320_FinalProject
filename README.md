# Studying periods of dominance in F1 by using Data Science
 <p>Our goal with this project will be to find commonalities and patterns between periods of multi-year dominance in the single-seater racing series Formula 1 (F1).</p> 
Our steps/general methodology:
<ol>
  <li>Download and manipulate the data</li>
  <li>Identify relevant periods</li>
  <li>Manipulate data and find correlations.</li>
  <li>Present results</li>
</ol> 

Dataset: F1DB: <a href="https://github.com/f1db/f1db" title="F1DB">our chosen dataset</a>

**Why are we choosing this Dataset?**

<p>We are choosing this dataset for a few reasons. This dataset is very detailed, and that is one big reason why we are using this data, as it has a lot of explorability to it. 
The data is also not very complicated, and it is easy to understand, like some of the data we use in lecture. A user can very easily open some of the data and make sense of it.
Our goal is to make a walkthrough on how to use data science techniques, and if the data is easy to comprehend, it makes the learning proccess easier. 
Plus, some of our group members are also interested in F1, making the topic personally engaging for members. It will be interesting to see which team(s) dominate throughout the years, and we hope to find some trend(s) with this data 
to use to bet on the next season :)</p>
